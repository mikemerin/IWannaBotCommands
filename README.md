### I Wanna Bot mIRC Commands

This is a repo to store the IWannaBot Commands used for Twitch's Fangame Marathon.

These commands are written in MSL (mIRC Scripting Language) and stored in a **remote.ini** file

While you cannot copy/paste the commands directly into the file (see location below) you can paste the commands by doing the following:

1. Open up mIRC
1. Click on the "Scripts Editor" button (5th from the left)
1. Click on the "Remote" tab
1. Paste Here
1. Click "OK" to save and reload

For reference, the location where **remote.ini** is located is **C:\Users\Mike\AppData\Roaming\mIRC\scripts**
